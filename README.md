# Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm
Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (KMP algorithm) is a string searching algorithm.
For a 'text string' of length `N` and a searching 'word' of length `M`, the algorithm finds all occurences of the 'word' in the 'text string' with time complexity `O(N + M)`.

The code contains a [class](KMP.hpp) which operates the algorithm.
